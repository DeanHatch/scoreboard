<hr>

<h2 id="label-Overview">Overview<span><a href="#label-Overview">&para;</a> <a href="#top">&uarr;</a></span></h2>

<pre>This functional specification is still in development
and will need to be revised several times before it is finalized.
The web pages described here merely give the underlying
functionality and flow of the application. The actual look
and feel will be developed iteratively over time with user feedback.</pre>

<p>Online-Scoreboard.net is an online service that keeps track of sporting
schedules and results.</p>

<p>There are four roles involved with the service. They are presented here in
<strong>increasing</strong> order of authority.</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Public Display Viewers - These are the fans and coaches of the teams that
are participating in the contests or anyone else who is interested in the
contests.  Collectively, all the contests and teams and groups of teams are
called a “Competition.” Viewer can view a Competition but they cannot
change any of the scores or schedules or anything else.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Scorers - These people can view everything and they can also record scores
for any of the contests in the Competition. They Scorers can also correct
scores, if needed. They cannot, however, schedule or re-schedule any of the
contests or manage the Teams or the Groupings of the Teams.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Managers - Managers can manage the Groupings and the Teams within the
Groupings. They can also schedule Contests or re-schedule Contests. Once a
Competition has been created, a Manager can do pretty much anything to the
Competition, including setting or changing a password to limit Scorer
access.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Customers - Customers are the owners of Competitions and, as such, can
create a Competition and once a Competition is created, the owner can do
anything to the Competition, including setting or changing a password to
limit Manager access and setting or changing a password to limit Scorer
access.</p>
</li></ul>

<h2 id="label-Scenarios">Scenarios<span><a href="#label-Scenarios">&para;</a> <a href="#top">&uarr;</a></span></h2>

<p>Scenarios help illustrate how people in the various roles would use the
system.</p>

<p>Take a gander at these scenarios:</p>

<h3 id="label-Scenario+1-3A+The+Harried+Parent.">Scenario 1: The Harried Parent.<span><a href="#label-Scenario+1-3A+The+Harried+Parent.">&para;</a> <a href="#top">&uarr;</a></span></h3>

<p>Pam drops off her son, Trevor, at the entrance to the Kalispell “Big Sky”
Basketball Megaplex to join his team for their tournament. After parking
her car, she pays her $10 entrance fee and looks for Trevor&#39;s team, the
Tomkats. She doesn&#39;t see them but she does see a group of parents and
coaches gathered around a sheet of paper taped to a wall. On the paper, she
sees that the Tomkats are Team 25. In the middle of the page on a grid she
sees that Team 25 plays 3 on Court 12 at 1. Realizing that it is two
minutes to one o&#39;clock, she scrambles to Court 12.  When she gets
there, an irate parent informs her that the Tomkats have been changed to
Team 24  because 24 was a no-show and 24 played 12 on Court 1 at 12, not 12
at 1.</p>

<p>Pam finds one of the Tournament Disorganizers and explains her frustration
at missing  her son&#39;s only game of the day. She complains that her ten
dollars has gotten her nothing and demands her money back.</p>

<p>What her hour and a half of driving and ten bucks has gotten her is  a five
minute explanation of the tournament No-Refund policy.</p>

<p>Sam has his hands full trying to keep up with updating the scores on the
printed schedules taped to the walls throughout the facility.</p>

<h3 id="label-Scenario+3-3A+The+Masterful+Manager.">Scenario 3: The Masterful Manager.<span><a href="#label-Scenario+3-3A+The+Masterful+Manager.">&para;</a> <a href="#top">&uarr;</a></span></h3>

<h2 id="label-Non+Goals">Non Goals<span><a href="#label-Non+Goals">&para;</a> <a href="#top">&uarr;</a></span></h2>

<p>This version will not support the following features, although it is
anticipated that they might become features in a subsequent version in the
near future:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Restrict Dates/Times that a particular Venue can be scheduled.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Restrict Dates/Times that a particular Team can be scheduled.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Automatically handle of Forfeits.</p>

Standings/Brackets and a ticker-type display of most recent results as well
as upcoming Contests.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Driving directions to Venues.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Prevent over-scheduling of Teams or overlapping Contests for a Team.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Recording of Scores by Smart-phone app.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Include Customer&#39;s own logo.</p>
</li></ul>

<p>These  features will not be included and will likely never be:</p>

<p>Determine tie-breakers.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Make a Silk Purse from a Sow&#39;s Ear.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Read the user&#39;s mind.</p>

<h2 id="label-Web+Page+Specifications">Web Page Specifications<span><a href="#label-Web+Page+Specifications">&para;</a> <a href="#top">&uarr;</a></span></h2>

<p>The overall layout will be the same for nearly all the Web Pages. The
layout will consist of a banner at the top, a Navigation Panel on the left,
main content to the right of the  Navigation Panel, and brief footer
information at the bottom. The Navigation Panel will  have links which will
vary based on the context. Instructions may be provided below the
navigation links. In the main content, a status message and other
informational messages will be displayed in a separate section at the top
of the main content.</p>

<p>Exceptions to this overall layout will be noted in this specification.</p>

<h3 id="label-Home+Pages">Home Pages<span><a href="#label-Home+Pages">&para;</a> <a href="#top">&uarr;</a></span></h3>

<p>This collection of pages will serve as a welcome to wandering visitors. It
will provide an introduction to the service and encourage visitors to dive
deeper into the service.  Visitors will be given the opportunity to become
Customers.</p>

<p>Navigation links point to the “Public Display” page, the “Scorer” page, the
“Manager” page,  or to the “Login/Register” page.</p>

<h3 id="label-Login-2FRegister+Page">Login/Register Page<span><a href="#label-Login-2FRegister+Page">&para;</a> <a href="#top">&uarr;</a></span></h3>

<p>Customer has a spot to enter their email address (which serves as their
userid) and password to login.</p>

<p>Also present on the page is a link to the Registration Page (below) for
people who are not yet Customers.</p>

<h3 id="label-Registration+Pages">Registration Pages<span><a href="#label-Registration+Pages">&para;</a> <a href="#top">&uarr;</a></span></h3>

<p>Customer-to-be has a spot to enter their email address (which will be their
userid) and a login password. They will need to enter this password a
second time to confirm. A second Registration Page will capture some more
particulars about the new Customer.</p>

<h3 id="label-Manager+Access+Page">Manager Access Page<span><a href="#label-Manager+Access+Page">&para;</a> <a href="#top">&uarr;</a></span></h3>

<p>The Customer who owns a Competition can set a password in order to restrict
access to the Manager functions for that Competition.  If such a password
has been set, then this page will prompt the user for the password and
validate the password before allowing the user to access the Manager Pages
for the Competition.</p>

<p>If no password has been set, then this page will be bypassed.</p>

<p>All of the Manager Pages which follow will have the same Navigation Panel
located on the left side of the page. The panel will consist of links to
the other Manager pages plus a link to the Scorer Page and a link to the
Public Display Page. The Scorer Page link and the Public Display Page link 
will open up new tabs in the browser.</p>

<h3 id="label-Dates-2FVenues+Pages">Dates/Venues Pages<span><a href="#label-Dates-2FVenues+Pages">&para;</a> <a href="#top">&uarr;</a></span></h3>

<p>In addition to the Navigation Panel on the left, the Main Date/Venue Page 
will have two parts to its main content. These two parts will be a List of
Dates and a List of Venues. Each list will be used to create drop-down
lists  for the scheduling of Contests.</p>

<p>The left side of the main content will be a list of Valid Dates for holding
Contests in this Competition. At the top of the list will be a selection
box for selecting a Date not already on the list and a submit button to add
the Date to the list.</p>

<p>The right side of the main content will be a list of Venues at which
Contests in this Competition can be held. At the top of the list will be a
text entry box for naming a Venue not already on the list and a submit
button to add the Venue to the list. Each Venue in the list will be a link
to the Venue Edit Page for that Venue. If the name of the Venue needs to be
corrected or the Venue needs to be deleted, the user will click on the
Venue name to bring up the Venue Edit Page for that Venue.</p>

<p>The Venue Edit Page will allow the Manager to change or correct the name of
the chosen Venue. It will also allow the Manager to delete the Venue, but
only if the Venue has not yet had any Contests scheduled at it.</p>

contests. Individual Contests can be scheduled or a Complete Round Robin
Schedule can be created. Optionally, Date(s)  and/or Locations (Venues) can
be specified for the Round Robin. Scheduled Contests can also have their
particulars (e.g. date/time, location, teams) changed on one of the
Scheduling pages.</p>

<p>This Manager Page displays the list of Groupings which can have Bracket
Contests and allows the Manager choose which Grouping to work on.  The
Bracket Contests Pages (next) are then confined to Teams from the selected

<p>All the information for a Competition is presented on this page. The user
can view different portions of the Competition by selecting a single Team
or a single Grouping on the page; the main contents display portion of the
page will show what is selected. A Navigation pane will always be present
on the left of the page for the purpose of selecting a different Grouping.</p>

<p>A link will be provided to display the contents of the currently selected
Standings, Schedule, Scores, or Bracket in a separate tab or window in a
printer-friendly layout. The printer-friendly layout will not have any
navigation pane or other links and is intended for producing a hard-copy
version of the display.</p>
