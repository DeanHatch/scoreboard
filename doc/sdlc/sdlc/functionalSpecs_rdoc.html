<hr>

<h2 id="label-Overview">Overview<span><a href="#label-Overview">&para;</a> <a href="#top">&uarr;</a></span></h2>

<pre>This functional specification is still in development
and will need to be revised several times before it is finalized.
The web pages described here merely give the underlying
functionality and flow of the application. The actual look
and feel will be developed iteratively over time with user feedback.</pre>

<p>Online-Scoreboard.net is an online service that keeps track of sporting
schedules and results. Only contests involving two contestants at a time
will be included; track meets, golf tournaments, and other such contests
involving a field of contestants competing against each other will not be
included.</p>

<p>There are four roles involved with the service. They are presented here in
<strong>increasing</strong> order of authority.</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Public Display Viewers - These are the fans and coaches of the teams that
are participating in the contests or anyone else who is interested in the
contests.  Collectively, all the contests and teams and groups of teams are
called a “Competition.” Viewer can view a Competition but they cannot
change any of the scores or schedules or anything else.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Scorers - These people can view everything and they can also record scores
for any of the contests in the Competition. They Scorers can also correct
scores, if needed. They cannot, however, schedule or re-schedule any of the
contests or manage the Teams or the Groupings of the Teams.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Managers - Managers can manage the Groupings and the Teams within the
Groupings. They can also schedule Contests or re-schedule Contests. Once a
Competition has been created, a Manager can do pretty much anything to the
Competition, including setting or changing a password to limit Scorer
access.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Customers - Customers are the owners of Competitions and, as such, can
create a Competition and once a Competition is created, the owner can do
anything to the Competition, including setting or changing a password to
limit Manager access and setting or changing a password to limit Scorer
access.</p>
</li></ul>

<h2 id="label-Scenarios">Scenarios<span><a href="#label-Scenarios">&para;</a> <a href="#top">&uarr;</a></span></h2>

<p>Scenarios help illustrate how people in the various roles would use the
system.</p>

<p>Take a gander at these scenarios:</p>

<h3 id="label-Scenario+1-3A+The+Harried+Parent.">Scenario 1: The Harried Parent.<span><a href="#label-Scenario+1-3A+The+Harried+Parent.">&para;</a> <a href="#top">&uarr;</a></span></h3>

<p>Pam drops off her son, Trevor, at the entrance to the Kalispell “Big Sky”
Basketball Megaplex to join his team for their tournament. After parking
her car, she pays her $10 entrance fee and looks for Trevor&#39;s team, the
Tomkats. She doesn&#39;t see them but she does see a group of parents and
coaches gathered around a sheet of paper taped to a wall. On the paper, she
sees that the Tomkats are Team 25. In the middle of the page on a grid she
sees that Team 25 plays 3 on Court 12 at 1. Realizing that it is two
minutes to one o&#39;clock, she scrambles to Court 12.  When she gets
there, an irate parent informs her that the Tomkats have been changed to
Team 24  because 24 was a no-show and 24 played 12 on 1 at 12, not on 12 at
1.</p>

<p>Pam finds one of the Tournament Disorganizers and explains her frustration
at missing  her son&#39;s only game of the day. She complains that her ten
dollars has gotten her nothing and demands her money back.</p>

<p>What her hour and a half of driving and ten bucks <strong>has</strong>
gotten her is  a five minute explanation of the tournament No-Refund
policy.</p>

<h3 id="label-Scenario+2-3A+The+Overworked+Organizer.">Scenario 2: The Overworked Organizer.<span><a href="#label-Scenario+2-3A+The+Overworked+Organizer.">&para;</a> <a href="#top">&uarr;</a></span></h3>

<p>Sam has his hands full trying to keep up with updating the scores on the
printed schedules taped to the walls throughout the facility.  Half his
time is spent running around  writing scores on sheets of paper taped to
walls and half his time is spent updating the schedules taped to walls and
half his time is spent dealing with irate moms who want their money back.</p>

<h3 id="label-Scenario+3-3A+The+Masterful+Manager.">Scenario 3: The Masterful Manager.<span><a href="#label-Scenario+3-3A+The+Masterful+Manager.">&para;</a> <a href="#top">&uarr;</a></span></h3>

<p>Cam the Man has learned not to answer his phone once a tournament starts
because it will probably just be Sam or one of his other staff members
asking him about some scheduling problem that has come up. The schedule
seemed to make so much sense to him when he was putting it together on his
spreadsheet. He tells his staff to tell the parents and coaches that the
key to reading the schedules is to remember their team number and just look
for that number in the grid on the schedule sheets.</p>

<p>It&#39;s really pretty easy once you get the hang of it.</p>

<h3 id="label-Scenario+4-3A+The+Fat-Cat+Promoter.">Scenario 4: The Fat-Cat Promoter.<span><a href="#label-Scenario+4-3A+The+Fat-Cat+Promoter.">&para;</a> <a href="#top">&uarr;</a></span></h3>

<p>Leo takes it personally when coaches at his tournament tell Leo that his
tournament is poorly run. He takes it personally because he runs the
tournament. He sees Cam and Sam running their tails off, so he knows it is
not a lack of hard work that makes his tournament so unpleasant for the
teams and their fans.</p>

<p>Leo is afraid of losing teams for the next tournament. He needs to do
something to improve the tournament&#39;s image and make the customers
happy.</p>

<h3 id="label-Scenario+5-3A+The+Next+Tournament.">Scenario 5: The Next Tournament.<span><a href="#label-Scenario+5-3A+The+Next+Tournament.">&para;</a> <a href="#top">&uarr;</a></span></h3>

<p>Leo knows that working smart is as important as working hard, so he turns
to <strong>Online-Scoreboard</strong>  to help him run his Next Tournament
more smoothly than the Last Tournament. He signs up as a Customer and,
after laying out the format and a few other particulars of the Tournament, 
he turns over the scheduling to Cam, since that&#39;s what Cam does.</p>

<p>Cam takes the link that Leo has given him and finds out that managing the
Tournament is really pretty easy, even easier than his old spreadsheets. He
sends a link on to Sam and tells him that he no longer will have to run
around to write scores on sheets taped around all the courts, he can just
enter the scores on his smart phone. Sam suggests to Cam that instead, he
send that link to all the teams and have the winning team of each game
enter the score.</p>

<p>“Brilliant!” exclaims Cam.  “I&#39;ll do it!”</p>

<p>Cam then emails the scorer link to each of the teams along with another
link that the teams and their  fans can use to keep up with scores and
schedules and standings on their tablet or laptops or  smartphones or
whatever.</p>

<p>Once the tournament begins, Cam worries that his phone is not working
because there are no irate phone messages waiting for him. In the morning,
he prints out the schedule for that day and tapes it to a wall (for the
old-school folks) and a few times a day he prints out  the scores and
standings up to that point and tapes them next to the schedule.</p>

<p>While doing this, Cam notices a mom of one of the players telling Sam “You
guys should have done this  a long time ago!” and thanking him for keeping
the Tournament running so well.</p>

<p>Later on, a game needs to be moved to a different court. Cam updates the
schedule online and then calls the two coaches to tell them about the
change and they each tell Cam that they were already texted the change, but
thanks anyways.</p>

<p>Cam says to himself “We should have done this a long time ago!”</p>

<h2 id="label-Non+Goals">Non Goals<span><a href="#label-Non+Goals">&para;</a> <a href="#top">&uarr;</a></span></h2>

<h2 id="label-Web+Page+Specifications">Web Page Specifications<span><a href="#label-Web+Page+Specifications">&para;</a> <a href="#top">&uarr;</a></span></h2>

<p>The overall layout will be the same for nearly all the Web Pages. The
layout will consist of a banner at the top, a Navigation Panel on the left,
main content to the right of the  Navigation Panel, and brief footer
information at the bottom. The Navigation Panel will  have links which will
vary based on the context. Instructions may be provided below the
navigation links. In the main content, a status message and other
informational messages will be displayed in a separate section at the top
of the main content.</p>

<p>Exceptions to this overall layout will be noted in this specification.</p>

<h3 id="label-Home+Pages">Home Pages<span><a href="#label-Home+Pages">&para;</a> <a href="#top">&uarr;</a></span></h3>

<p>This collection of pages will serve as a welcome to wandering visitors. It
will provide an introduction to the service and encourage visitors to dive
deeper into the service.  Visitors will be given the opportunity to become
Customers.</p>

<p>Navigation links point to the “Public Display” page, the “Scorer” page, the
“Manager” page,  or to the “Login/Register” page.</p>

<h3 id="label-Login-2FRegister+Page">Login/Register Page<span><a href="#label-Login-2FRegister+Page">&para;</a> <a href="#top">&uarr;</a></span></h3>

<p>Customer has a spot to enter their email address (which serves as their
userid) and password to login.</p>

<p>Also present on the page is a link to the Registration Page (below) for
people who are not yet Customers.</p>

<h3 id="label-Registration+Pages">Registration Pages<span><a href="#label-Registration+Pages">&para;</a> <a href="#top">&uarr;</a></span></h3>

<p>Customer-to-be has a spot to enter their email address (which will be their
userid) and a login password. They will need to enter this password a
second time to confirm. A second Registration Page will capture some more
particulars about the new Customer.</p>

<h3 id="label-Manager+Access+Page">Manager Access Page<span><a href="#label-Manager+Access+Page">&para;</a> <a href="#top">&uarr;</a></span></h3>

<p>The Customer who owns a Competition can set a password in order to restrict
access to the Manager functions for that Competition.  If such a password
has been set, then this page will prompt the user for the password and
validate the password before allowing the user to access the Manager Pages
for the Competition.</p>

<p>If no password has been set, then this page will be bypassed.</p>

<p>All of the Manager Pages which follow will have the same Navigation Panel
located on the left side of the page. The panel will consist of links to
the other Manager pages plus a link to the Scorer Page and a link to the
Public Display Page. The Scorer Page link and the Public Display Page link 
will open up new tabs in the browser.</p>

<h3 id="label-Dates-2FVenues+Pages">Dates/Venues Pages<span><a href="#label-Dates-2FVenues+Pages">&para;</a> <a href="#top">&uarr;</a></span></h3>

<p>In addition to the Navigation Panel on the left, the Main Date/Venue Page 
will have two parts to its main content. These two parts will be a List of
Dates and a List of Venues. Each list will be used to create drop-down
lists  for the scheduling of Contests.</p>

<p>The left side of the main content will be a list of Valid Dates for holding
Contests in this Competition. At the top of the list will be a selection
box for selecting a Date not already on the list and a submit button to add
the Date to the list.</p>

<p>The right side of the main content will be a list of Venues at which
Contests in this Competition can be held. At the top of the list will be a
text entry box for naming a Venue not already on the list and a submit
button to add the Venue to the list. Each Venue in the list will be a link
to the Venue Edit Page for that Venue. If the name of the Venue needs to be
corrected or the Venue needs to be deleted, the user will click on the
Venue name to bring up the Venue Edit Page for that Venue.</p>

<p>The Venue Edit Page will allow the Manager to change or correct the name of
the chosen Venue. It will also allow the Manager to delete the Venue, but
only if the Venue has not yet had any Contests scheduled at it.</p>
