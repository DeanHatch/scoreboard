<p>Welcome to Online-Scoreboard.net!  This is the place where you can post results, keeping teams and fans informed with up to the minute scores. 
</p>
<p>
Recording scores is really pretty easy.  On the Scorer page you will find a list of games ready for scores and a list of scores that can be corrected for the <%= @competition.fullname() %>.
</p>

<p>
Use this <a href="<%= @url %>" target="_blank">link</a> to go to the Scorer&apos;s page.
  You will need to contact someone at <b><%= @competition.organization.name() %></b>
  for the password, if there is one.
