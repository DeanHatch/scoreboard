<%= @recipient %>,

Welcome to Online-Scoreboard.net! This is the place where you can post results, keeping teams and fans informed with up to the minute scores. 

Recording scores is really pretty easy.  On the Scorer page you will find a list of games ready for scores and a list of scores that can be corrected for the <%= @competition.fullname() %>.

Use this link (<%= @url %>) to go to the Scorer's page.  You will need to contact someone at <%= @competition.organization.name() %> for the password, if there is one.

(You might want to bookmark that link.) 

Welcome aboard!
